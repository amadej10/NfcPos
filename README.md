# NFC POS application 🌟

As a side project, I'm creating a mobile app that can scan NFC tags and communicate with a common API. These tags hold the user balance and users can pay with their NFC tag (wristband or a card). The app can be used as a cash register and also allows top-ups and withdrawals. I aim to build an app that can be used for small events and should be easy to self-host. I will also use this project for learning and trying new things. 🏗️
